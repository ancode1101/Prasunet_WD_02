# 🚀 Task Completed: Building a Stopwatch Web Application 🚀
I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed a project to build a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎉

# Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch that allows users to:
Start ⏯️: Begin timing with a simple click.
Pause ⏸️: Pause the stopwatch and resume later.
Reset 🔄: Reset the stopwatch to zero.
Lap Times 🏁: Record and display lap times to track intervals.

# Technologies Used:
HTML: Structured the elements of the application.
CSS: Styled the application for a clean and intuitive user experience.
JavaScript​: Implemented functionality for starting, pausing, resetting, and tracking lap times.

# Highlights:
Responsive Design: Ensures the stopwatch works seamlessly across different devices.
Interactive Interface: User-friendly buttons and displays for ease of use.
Lap Time Tracking: Allows users to measure and record specific time intervals.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to sharpen my web development skills and create a practical tool. I’m looking forward to applying these skills to even more complex projects in the future.
